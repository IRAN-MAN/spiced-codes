/*
Write a function called translateNumberToGerman that tries to get a number between 1 and 10 
by calling another function called askForNumber.
 If askForNumber returns a number between 1 and 10, translateNumberToGerman should return 
 the German translation of that number as a string.
If askForNumber does not return a number between 1 and 10 and instead throws 
an exception, translateNumberToGerman should log the error message to the console and 
restart the whole process. The user should keep being prompted to input a number between 1 and 10 until 
she does so.
