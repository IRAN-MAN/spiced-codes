1. create the board ( 6 rows, 7 columns  )
	* a container to wrap the board 
	* 7 divs => columns
	* 6 divs => rows > 1 div circle
2. style the board 
	* backgorund-colors
	* flex, flex-wrap
	* classes => .palayer-1, .player-2, .board, .circle
3. JavaScript
	* cache the selectors that needed => board, columns, 
    * keep track of current player
    * switch between players 1 and 2 (switchPlayers function)
        * switchPlayers 
            * if the currentPlayer is 1 then switch it to 2 otherwise switch to 1
	* eventListener on click on columns
        * get the targeted column index
		* update the board with new token droped in selectedColumn and return the row index (dropToken function)
            * dropToken 
                * pass the correct arguments (columnHolders)
                * find the first available columnHolder (check if its taken or not)
                    * loop through the target coloumn and check if any of them has player's class (loop reverse)            
                * if there is one, assign the corresponding current player's class and return its index (i)
                * if there's no empty holders on the column, return -1 (to use as preventing user to drop token on a full column)
            
    
    
	

	
	
	* diagonam  wiinning check
        *getDiagonalPositions and assign to diagonalPosition
            * use columnIndex
            * cache all columnHolders
            * get the index of current columnHolder 0 - 41
            * have an array of diagonal positions which has 4 numbers that are winners
